= Sheep Eat Grass =

Backport to Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 of the feature from later versions where
sheep regrow their wool by eating grass.

== Installation ==
This is a https://babric.github.io/[Babric] mod, just put it into your "mods" folder.

== API ==
This mod provides an API for other mods to add custom behaviour when sheep eat their blocks.

The API is entirely composed of the EatingRegistry class, which is documented in the source code (Javadoc coming soon™️️).
