# Sheep Eat Grass

Backport to Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 of the feature from later versions where sheep
regrow their wool by eating grass.

## Installation
This is a [Babric](https://babric.github.io/) mod, just put it into your "mods" folder.

## API
This mod provides an API for other mods to add custom behaviour when sheep eat their blocks, includable as a Jar-in-Jar dependency through Fabric.
